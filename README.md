# Statistics-in-Applied-Linguistics-with-R

In this repository, I have conducted statistical tests prevalent in Applied Linguistics. 
To begin with, I performed correlation analysis, independent-samples t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and multiple regression analysis centering around L2 research data.
More tests will be added to this repository. 
Stay tuned for updates!
