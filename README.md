# Statistics-in-Applied-Linguistics-with-R

In This repository, I have conducted statistical tests prevalent in Applied Linguistics. 
To begin with, I performed Correlation, independent-sample t-test, and multiple regression analyses centering around L2 research data.
More tests would be added in this repository, such as ANOVA, ANCOVA, Repeated-Measure ANOVA, and more. 
Stay tuned for updates!
